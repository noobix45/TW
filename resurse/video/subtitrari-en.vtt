00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.600 line:0 align:middle
that's when i can tell a guitar is good

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600 line:0 align:middle
from just that amount of playing that

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.360 line:0 align:middle
the strings will go with you the way you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.680 line:0 align:middle
want them to that you've got high end

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680 line:0 align:middle

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680 line:0 align:middle
<i>end<i>
